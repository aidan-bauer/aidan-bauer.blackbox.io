	<blockquote>Hey boss, just going to check in real quick. We had to shut off one of the starboard thrusters because it said it was on even though it was switched off; didn't want to take the risk of leaving it like that and wasting fuel. Other than that, things are going very well. New engines are working just fine, no complaints at all. Will keep you posted.<br>

	<blockquote>Captain,<br>
	<br>
	You asked me to send you my thoughts when I felt I could objectively do so, so here they are.<br>
	<br>
	First, we should congradulate ourselves on this discovery. We've found the first organic matter outside of earth! Imagine that! And how it happened all by accident as well! Oh, it's too much. But anyway, you asked me to be calm, so I will be calm.<br>
	<br>
	What we thought was a rock is in fact a large chunk of organic matter. What it is exactly remains unclear; we can tell that it's organic due to the trace substances the tests revealed, but beyond that we can't tell the structure of the substance itself. It matches nothing we have on record.<br>
	<br>
	I've done all the tests I can here. A bigger lab with better equipment will most certainly yield better results. I understand we have a mission, but this can't wait. This can't wait for anything.<br>

	<blockquote>Whatever Hideo did seems to have worked. I was able to count 14 bodies outside of the Kittyhawk; I'll talk to people, try to determine how many were sucked out. Until we know for certain we should play it safe.<br>
	<br>
	I don't know what our situation on air and water and food is, but I've got us aimed back towards home. Engines took a lot of damage, but we'll be back up to speed before too long.<br>
	<br>
	Just one thing: I think the radio might be fried. Seeing as all our radiomen are out of it, can you send Eric up to give this thing a look over? He would know better than me how to use it.<br>

	<blockquote>Nothing works up here. The radio, data slates, computers are all fried to hell and back. Have to type this because we think one of them might be outside; can't take the chance that it's just a loose panel.<br>
	<br>
	Like I said, radio's fried bad. I've managed to get it working enough to broadcast a distress signal, but that's all we're going to get out of it. Nothing left to but to send out the black box, for what it's work. Lindpere says he can time it with the Kittyhawk's rotation so it goes back towards earth so someone might find it, but it's a shot in the dark.<br>
	<br>
	I want to say it's been an honor, Hans. Most of us are still alive, we have air, water, some food, and we're not at each other's throats. And we have you to thank for a lot of that. When, not if, we make it through, they'll know what you did for all of us.<br>
	<br>
	See you in a bit.</blockquote></p>
